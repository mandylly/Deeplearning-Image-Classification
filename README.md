# Deeplearning-Image-Classification

## Dataset
Dataset resource: [https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats-redux-kernels-edition/overview]
The train dataset contains 25,000 images of dogs and cats.
Each image in this folder has the label as part of the filename (that is, having "cat" or "dog" in their file names).

The test dataset contains 12,500 images, named according to a numeric id.
For each image in the test set, I predict a probability that the image is a dog (1 = dog, 0 = cat).

## Method
1. Build 1 CNN Model and plot its performace
2. Try Inception-Resnet Model to enhance performance. Besides, also implement image augmentation method to help with model performance.
